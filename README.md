# MedDic-ADE
Japanese medical term normalization dictionary for cancer-related adverse drug events (ADEs)

manually augmenting the Japanese disease dictionary [Manbyo](https://sociocom.naist.jp/manbyo-dic-en/), and the aforementioned [Hyakuyaku](https://sociocom.naist.jp/hyakuyaku-dic-en/). 
Each dictionary entry includes a surface expression, its medical concept, and seven popular adverse drug effects (ADEs) in cancer treatment.

These surface expressions, which are often symptom-like phrases, are categorized as parent diseases and labeled with corresponding ICD codes. 
We further label each surface expression with relevance to frequent adverse effects of anti-cancer drugs, such as stomatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hand-foot syndrome.
